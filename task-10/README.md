This was a big task and i had to watch the last 3 week of videos and problem sets within 1 week so i had to rush a lot.I had to watch tutorials for some problems as i couldnt figure them out on my own.
But i did learn a lot more about C.Some ideas i have not really understood,especially from last week. So i plan on going through those once again later when i get time.
